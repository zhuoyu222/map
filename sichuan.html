    <h1>Sichuan Cuisine</h1>
    <p>Beef is well known in this part of the country, and wheat and rice alternate. Familiar in the US are these regional dishes: hot and sour soup, hot and spicy cucumber salad, mapo tofu, and Sichuan noodles. Expect chili peppers with everything, or maybe the numbing taste of the non-chili red peppercorns.</p>
