        <h2>North China Cuisine</h2>
        <p>Beijing cuisine, or Jingcai (京菜), arguably incorporates the best from all corners of the region, as well as its own unique tradition of street foods. Some essential Beijing foods and snacks include tanghulu (糖葫芦) — candied hawthorn berries on a stick — lamb hotpot, jianbing, Beijing-style zhajiangmian (made with yellow bean instead of the conventional sweet bean paste), and of course, Peking duck.</p>

        <h2>Sichuan Cuisine</h2>
        <p>Sichuan food is famous for its mala (麻辣) or numbing hot spiciness, thanks to its beloved peppercorn. The chili pepper was first introduced to China by South America around the end of the 17th century. The Sichuanese ran with it, and never looked back.</p>

        <h2>Cantonese Cuisine</h2>
        <p>Cantonese Cuisine is seen as very soup-forward — according to traditional Chinese medicine, soup cools the body down, which is helpful in Guangdong’s humid, subtropical climate. And since it’s on the coast, where fresh produce is readily available, there is also no need for the preservation techniques that produce very strong or spicy flavors.</p>
